         * 1. Define a class for an album, which contain two strings.
         *   One is the name of the artist; the other is the genre of music ("Rock", "Jazz", etc) that is on the album.
         * 2. Create a Song class to include a field onAlbum with type Album.
         * 3. Make an Examples.java and add example Song data to include the new Album field.
         * 4. stub out a method called `onSameAlbum` that determines whether two Songs are on the same album (returning a boolean).
         * 5. stub out a method `operationalize` to the Album class that appends "opera" to the genre if it does not already contain "opera".
         *   Ex: "rock" -> "rock opera"
         *   It might help to UML these out to get an idea for what is being asked for.
         * 6. Add some test cases (THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE DEBUGGING PART)
         * 7. Implement our methods, debugging the tests as we go.
